    "## Introduction\n",
    " ### In this project, we aim to develop a flight fare prediction model using machine learning techniques. Our team, comprising Md Aftab, Sourav Sharma, and Tojum Tasar, will explore and analyze a dataset to predict flight prices based on various features such as the airline type, arrival time, departure time, flight duration, source, destination, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "#### Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will thoroughly investigate the dataset, extracting meaningful insights through mathematical analysis and visualizations to understand the underlying patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering:\n",
    "#### Key transformations and selections will be applied to refine the dataset for better prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Development:\n",
    "#### Leveraging machine learning algorithms, we will build a robust model to predict flight fares based on the given features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this project, we aim to deliver a fully functional prediction model and gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.\n",

    "### About the Flight Fare Prediction Dataset\n",
    "#### Airline: So this column will have all the types of airlines like Indigo, Jet Airways, Air India, and many more.\n",
    "#### Date_of_Journey: This column will let us know about the date on which the passenger’s journey will start.\n",
    "#### Source: This column holds the name of the place from where the passenger’s journey will start.\n",
    "#### Destination: This column holds the name of the place to where passengers wanted to travel.\n",
    "#### Route: Here we can know about that what is the route through which passengers have opted to travel from his/her source to their destination.\n",
    "#### Arrival_Time: Arrival time is when the passenger will reach his/her destination.\n",
    "#### Duration: Duration is the whole period that a flight will take to complete its journey from source to destination.\n",
    "#### Total_Stops: This will let us know in how many places flights will stop there for the flight in the whole journey.\n",
    "#### Additional_Info: In this column, we will get information about food, kind of food, and other amenities.\n",
    "#### Price: Price of the flight for a complete journey including all the expenses before onboarding.\n",
    "#### By employing machine learning algorithms, particularly regression techniques, we aim to predict flight ticket prices accurately. Leveraging Python for data analysis (regression analysis) and utilizing various machine learning models, including linear regression, will allow us to conduct comprehensive flight price prediction analyses. Additionally, with a focus on the Indian aviation market, we can tailor our predictive models to suit the specific dynamics of this region."
